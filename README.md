# Substance-abuse-analysis
Analysis on SUD in men and how it effects their children. Are there children going to have attachment issues? how does the fathers issues impact their well-being? 
ICPSR
After looking through the code book for the ICPSR study https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/33444, I have decided that I am interested in substance abuse in men with children and how it effects their relationship with their children and I am also interested in how the SUD effects spousal relations. how does SUD effect family dynamics. 
The variables that I will be including in my dataset will be Age of Onset, criminal history, age of father, number of children, family hisotry of SUD, mental health disorders, and living situation for the children.
