# discrimination shaping attitudes toward interracial dating analysis
Analysis on views from different women/male races and how discrimination effected their thoughts toward interracial dating and marriage in 2012.
After looking through the code book for the ICPSR study https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/35348?q=outlook+on+LIfe&searchSource=find-analyze-home&sortBy=, I have decided that I am interested in is To what extent do perceptions of discrimination shape attitudes toward interracial dating and marriage across race-gender groups? 
The variables that I will be including in my dataset will be Age, race, religon, political views, and sexual orientation.
