Analysis on substance abuse in father's and how much it effects their children.
ICPSR
After looking through the code book for the ICPSR study https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/33444, I have decided that I am interested in substance abuse in men and how it effects their relationship with their children and I am also interested in how the substance abuse effects the households of the abusers.
